The African Centers of Excellence in Bioinformatics (ACE) are a
consortium of research and training centers facilitated by the NIHâ€™s
[National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/)
in collaboration with research institutions in Africa, private sector
companies, and the [Foundation for the NIH](https://fnih.org/) (FNIH).

The ACE Centers provide high-performance scientific computing
infrastructure, virtual reality (VR) biovisualization, and 3D printing
capabilities as platforms for training in bioinformatics, data
science, and data analytics.  Students, teachers, and researchers
share skills, knowledge, and best practices among global biomedical
research community members.

The consortium welcomes questions, comments and feedback about our
program and website.  Please submit requests for use of
infrastrucutre, provide suggestions, and ask questions about our
Centers using
